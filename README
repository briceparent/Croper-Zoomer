Croper-Zoomer
=============

Created for the project "L'archipel des Echappes"

Dual licenced under the GPL v2 and the CeCILL licences.



PHP script that allows a user to graphically crop and zoom his images.

Requires the GD module for PHP

Only tested with PHP 5.3


For now (and until i'm asked for it), only returns 1535x864px PNG images (which is 1280x720 with a factor of 1.2, in order to be able to make small zooms on it)
